# Multi-Site-GRE-VPN-Topology-PNETLab
This project demonstrates a multi-site enterprise network using GRE tunnels implemented in PNETLab. Multiple geographic locations are interconnected through GRE tunnels over an ISP core, enabling secure and logical communication between remote branches. The design highlights tunneling concepts, scalable routing, and real-world WAN connectivity.
